# JavaScriptmas 2022

I participated in this year's code challenge called [JavaScriptmas 2022](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas) which took place on the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) platform.

From the first of December until the 24th, a new challenge appeared every day to test your existing coding knowledge. But most of all, it's fun because the Scrimba team set it up in a really funny and imaginative way.

You can also find my solution here with a link to the Scrimba fork.
